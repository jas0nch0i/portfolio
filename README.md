## Measure Reference

All measures reside in the `_Measures` table, organized into display folders.

### Revenue Measures

#### Total Revenue

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Revenue |
| Format | $#,0 |
| DAX | `SUM(Fact_Sales[NetAmount])` |

**Business Logic:** Calculates total net sales revenue after discounts across all orders. This is the primary top-line KPI used in executive reporting. It sums the `NetAmount` column, which represents the final revenue after discount deductions.

---

#### Total Profit

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Revenue |
| Format | $#,0 |
| DAX | `SUM(Fact_Sales[Profit])` |

**Business Logic:** Calculates total bottom-line profit across all orders. Profit is computed as net revenue minus cost of goods sold. This is the key profitability indicator for Board and Executive review.

---

#### Profit Margin %

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Revenue |
| Format | 0.0% |
| DAX | `DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Revenue])` |

**Business Logic:** Expresses profit as a percentage of net revenue. Uses `DIVIDE` for safe division, returning BLANK if revenue is zero. Indicates overall pricing efficiency and cost management. A declining margin may signal rising costs or excessive discounting.

---

#### Total Gross

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Revenue |
| Format | $#,0 |
| DAX | `SUM(Fact_Sales[GrossAmount])` |

**Business Logic:** Calculates total sales at full list price before any discounts. Comparing Total Gross to Total Revenue reveals the dollar impact of discounting strategies.

---

### Volume Measures

#### Total Orders

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Volume |
| Format | #,0 |
| DAX | `DISTINCTCOUNT(Fact_Sales[OrderID])` |

**Business Logic:** Counts the number of unique sales orders. Uses `DISTINCTCOUNT` to avoid double-counting if the model evolves to include line-item-level detail. Measures transaction volume independent of order size.

---

#### Total Quantity

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Volume |
| Format | #,0 |
| DAX | `SUM(Fact_Sales[Quantity])` |

**Business Logic:** Total physical units sold across all orders. Measures sales volume independent of pricing or revenue. Useful for supply chain and inventory planning context.

---

#### Avg Order Value

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Volume |
| Format | $#,0 |
| DAX | `DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Orders])` |

**Business Logic:** Average revenue generated per order. Tracks whether order size is growing or shrinking over time. A declining AOV alongside growing order count may indicate a shift toward lower-value products.

---

### Discount Measures

#### Total Discount

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Discounts |
| Format | $#,0 |
| DAX | `SUM(Fact_Sales[DiscountAmount])` |

**Business Logic:** Total dollar value of discounts given across all orders. Tracks the cost of promotional and volume discounting strategies. Rising discount dollars should be monitored against revenue growth to ensure net-positive ROI.

---

#### Discount Rate %

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Discounts |
| Format | 0.0% |
| DAX | `DIVIDE([Total Discount], [Total Gross])` |

**Business Logic:** Discount as a percentage of gross (pre-discount) sales. Measures how aggressively discounts are being applied. A rising rate over time may signal margin erosion or over-reliance on promotional pricing.

---

### Trend Measures

#### Revenue YoY %

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Trends |
| Format | 0.0% |
| DAX | |

```dax
VAR CY = [Total Revenue]
VAR CurrentYear = MAX(Dim_Date[Year])
VAR PY = CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    FILTER(ALL(Dim_Date), Dim_Date[Year] = CurrentYear - 1)
)
RETURN
    IF(HASONEVALUE(Dim_Date[Year]) && PY, DIVIDE(CY - PY, PY))
```

**Business Logic:** Year-over-year percentage change in revenue. Compares the current year's revenue to the prior year. The `HASONEVALUE` guard ensures this measure returns BLANK when multiple years are selected (e.g., slicer set to "All"), preventing misleading cross-year comparisons at the grand total level. A positive value indicates revenue growth; negative indicates decline.

---

#### Profit YoY %

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Trends |
| Format | 0.0% |
| DAX | |

```dax
VAR CY = [Total Profit]
VAR CurrentYear = MAX(Dim_Date[Year])
VAR PY = CALCULATE(
    [Total Profit],
    FILTER(ALL(Dim_Date), Dim_Date[Year] = CurrentYear - 1)
)
RETURN
    IF(HASONEVALUE(Dim_Date[Year]) && PY, DIVIDE(CY - PY, PY))
```

**Business Logic:** Year-over-year percentage change in profit. Same pattern as Revenue YoY % but applied to the bottom line. The `HASONEVALUE` guard prevents misleading grand total comparisons. Comparing Revenue YoY % alongside Profit YoY % reveals whether growth is translating to the bottom line.

---

### Ranking Measures

#### Revenue Rank (Region)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Rankings |
| Format | #,0 |
| DAX | `IF(HASONEVALUE(Dim_Customer[Region]), RANKX(ALL(Dim_Customer[Region]), [Total Revenue], , DESC, Dense))` |

**Business Logic:** Ranks geographic regions by total revenue (1 = highest). Uses Dense ranking so tied regions share the same rank. Returns BLANK at aggregate level to prevent misleading total-row rankings. Enables quick identification of best and worst performing regions.

---

#### Revenue Rank (Store)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Rankings |
| Format | #,0 |
| DAX | `IF(HASONEVALUE(Dim_Store[StoreName]), RANKX(ALL(Dim_Store[StoreName]), [Total Revenue], , DESC, Dense))` |

**Business Logic:** Ranks store locations by total revenue (1 = highest). Supports identification of top and bottom performing stores for operational review and resource allocation decisions.

---

#### Revenue Rank (Product)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Rankings |
| Format | #,0 |
| DAX | `IF(HASONEVALUE(Dim_Product[ProductName]), RANKX(ALL(Dim_Product[ProductName]), [Total Revenue], , DESC, Dense))` |

**Business Logic:** Ranks products by total revenue (1 = highest). Supports Top N product analysis for executive reporting. Used in conjunction with visual-level TopN filters to show the top 10 revenue-generating products.

---

#### Profit Rank (Product)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Display Folder | Rankings |
| Format | #,0 |
| DAX | `IF(HASONEVALUE(Dim_Product[ProductName]), RANKX(ALL(Dim_Product[ProductName]), [Total Profit], , DESC, Dense))` |

**Business Logic:** Ranks products by total profit (1 = highest). Highlights products with the best margin contribution versus pure revenue volume. Comparing revenue rank to profit rank for the same product reveals margin efficiency — a product ranked high in revenue but low in profit may warrant pricing review.

---

## Data Sources

All data is sourced from CSV files loaded via Power Query (M language) in Import mode.

### Source Files

| Table | Source File | Delimiter | Encoding | Columns |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Fact_Sales | `Fact_Sales.csv` | Comma | 1252 (Windows) | 15 |
| Dim_Date | `Dim_Date.csv` | Comma | 1252 (Windows) | 14 |
| Dim_Customer | `Dim_Customer.csv` | Comma | 1252 (Windows) | 10 |
| Dim_Product | `Dim_Product.csv` | Comma | 1252 (Windows) | 8 |
| Dim_Store | `Dim_Store.csv` | Comma | 1252 (Windows) | 10 |
| Dim_SalesRep | `Dim_SalesRep.csv` | Comma | 1252 (Windows) | 9 |

**Source Directory:** `C:\Users\jchoi\OneDrive\Desktop\Claude Code\PBI Projects\Sales-Dashboard\`

### Power Query Transformation Steps

Each table follows the same three-step ETL pattern:

| Step | Operation | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `Csv.Document(File.Contents(...))` | Load raw CSV file from local path |
| 2 | `Table.PromoteHeaders` | Promote first row to column headers |
| 3 | `Table.TransformColumnTypes` | Apply explicit data types to all columns |

**Type Mappings Applied:**

| Source Type | Power Query Type | Applied To |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Integer keys | `Int64.Type` | All PK/FK columns, Year, QuarterNumber, MonthNumber, etc. |
| Text fields | `type text` | Names, categories, regions, statuses |
| Dates | `type date` | Date, CustomerSince, HireDate, OpenDate |
| Decimals | `type number` | UnitPrice, UnitCost, CommissionRate, all monetary amounts |

**Notes:**
- No advanced transformations (merges, pivots, custom columns) are applied — all business logic resides in DAX measures
- The CSV source paths are absolute local paths; these will need updating if the project is migrated to a different machine or to a cloud data source (e.g., SharePoint, Azure Blob, Databricks)
- Encoding 1252 (Windows Latin-1) handles standard ASCII and Western European characters
