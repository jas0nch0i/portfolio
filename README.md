This project demonstrates how AI can support dashboard prototyping, documentation, logic refinement, and repeatable BI workflow improvement.

**What this project demonstrates**
- AI-assisted dashboard development
- Documentation and process standardization
- Faster report iteration and refinement
- Practical use of prompt engineering in analytics workflows

### [3. Reporting Automation Toolkit](https://github.com/jas0nch0i/reporting-automation-toolkit)
**Reusable automation patterns for Power BI deployment, measure generation, theming, and documentation**

A toolkit of Python and TMDL-based automation patterns that compress recurring reporting work — measure authoring, theme application, semantic-model documentation, and PBIP deployment — into repeatable, version-controlled workflows.

**What this project demonstrates**
- Power BI deployment automation via PBIP / TMDL / Git
- Batch DAX measure generation from structured input (CSV → TMDL)
- Schema-validated theme JSON generation with structural color tokens
- Semantic-model documentation auto-generated from TMDL files
- Workflow orchestration with AI-assisted measure naming and description drafting

**Tech stack:** Python · pandas · Jinja2 · TMDL · PBIP · Power BI Desktop · Ajv (JSON Schema validation) · GitHub Actions

**Pilot results (framework targets, validated on internal pilot builds):**
- Dashboard deployment cycles reduced from ~6 close-reopen rounds to **2-3** through coordinate-table layout planning
- Measure authoring throughput **~5x faster** for batches of 15+ measures via templated generation
- Theme refresh on 30-visual report: **2 hours → 5 minutes** by switching to structural color tokens
- Semantic-model documentation generated in **<5 minutes** per model (previously a manual half-day exercise)

### [4. Customer Segmentation Analysis](https://github.com/jas0nch0i/customer-segmentation-analysis)
**RFM segmentation, k-means clustering, and supervised churn classification on public retail data**

An end-to-end segmentation case study using the UCI Online Retail II dataset. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features feed an unsupervised k-means clustering pipeline that surfaces five customer segments with distinct value and engagement profiles. A supplementary supervised-learning track trains a gradient-boosted classifier on the IBM Telco Churn dataset to predict at-risk customers and quantify driver importance.

**What this project demonstrates**
- Feature engineering for customer analytics (RFM, recency decay, monetary log-scaling)
- Unsupervised segmentation with k-means + elbow / silhouette validation
- Persona development translating cluster centroids into business-readable archetypes
- Supervised classification (Gradient Boosting / XGBoost) with calibrated probability outputs
- Model evaluation: confusion matrix, ROC / AUC, feature importance
- Business interpretation: segment-targeted retention and cross-sell recommendations

**Tech stack:** Python · pandas · scikit-learn · XGBoost · matplotlib · seaborn · Jupyter · Power BI (segment dashboard layer)

**Datasets (public)**
- [UCI Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii) — UK online retailer, ~1M transactions (2009–2011)
- [IBM Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) — 7,043 telecom customers with churn labels

**Sample results (5-cluster solution on bundled synthetic-retail dataset; structure mirrors UCI Online Retail II)**
- 5 segments identified: *Champions · Loyal Customers · At-Risk Spenders · New Casuals · Hibernating*
- Top segment (*Champions*) — 11% of customers, 37% of revenue
- Top 2 segments combined — 35% of customers, 68% of revenue
- Silhouette score: **0.55** (k=5)

**Sample results (gradient-boosted churn model on bundled synthetic Telco-like dataset)**
- ROC AUC: **0.77**
- Recall on churn class: **0.92** (threshold tuned for retention focus list)
- Top 3 features by importance: contract type (multi-year = protective), monthly + total charges, tenure
- Pipeline reproducible on real IBM Telco dataset — typical real-data ROC AUC ≈ 0.84

### [5. Streamlit Apps on Databricks (Currently Exploring)](https://github.com/jas0nch0i/streamlit-databricks-apps)
**Local Streamlit mockups designed for deployment as Databricks Apps — analyst tooling, queue triage, and platform cost monitoring**

A working set of Streamlit apps built as local prototypes for eventual deployment as Databricks Apps. Each app explores a different analyst-facing or operations-facing surface, with a companion cost-monitoring reference toolkit so the spend story is explicit before deployment.

**What this project demonstrates**
- Streamlit UI patterns — multi-tab layouts, cached data loaders, session-state handoff, form-gated expensive operations
- Weighted scoring engines for queue triage (SLA, resubmittal, complexity, staleness, project size)
- Operational UX — worklists, team-ops dashboards, configurable rules
- Analyst utilities — file ingestion, schema inspection, auto-detected joins, pivot + chart on arbitrary data
- Cost discipline — system-table queries, tagging strategy, budget policies, and a recommended monitoring dashboard for any Streamlit app on Databricks

**Tech stack:** Streamlit · pandas · Python · Databricks SQL Warehouse (target) · Unity Catalog (target) · Databricks Apps (target deployment)

**Apps included**
- **Plan Review Triage** — permit / plan-review queue triage with weighted scoring, team ops view, and editable rules
- **Analyst Toolkit** — CSV/Excel explorer + multi-sheet auto-join utility
- **Databricks Cost Monitoring** — reference guide for monitoring Streamlit / Databricks App spend (system tables, queries, dashboard layout)

> Status: local mockups against synthetic data. Databricks Apps deployment is the next step.
